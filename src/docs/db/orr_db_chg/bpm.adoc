== Business Process Modeling.

The biggest problem for dbOpera system is lack of a common platform for business and development.
Those two words has no connection.

During last years we were not able to build formal language for describing system in way understandable for both business and development.
Solution might be Business Process Modeling.
I am pretty sure in Deutche Bank are applicable BPM tools (like JBoss BPM suite or SAP BPM), and I think we should consider implement this solution in this area.

Implementation of this kind of tool would able change state from _human-centric_ approach into more service orientated platform, what seems be in accordance with PaaS strategy.
