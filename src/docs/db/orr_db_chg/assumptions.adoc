= Assumptions

The are some universal values which we want to achieve, like:
	 * increase business process transparency
	 * simplify maintenance process
	 * reduce failure rate
	 * increase the effectiveness of implementing changes
	 * make GUI more intuitive 
	 etc.

To measure effectiveness in each of those points we should start define the performance metrics and measures.
	 
	 
== Increase 

 we do not have 
	1. Achieve business flow more transparent?
	2. Build environment where change is based on robust unambiguous source (more independent from people).
